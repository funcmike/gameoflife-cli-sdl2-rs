# gameoflife-cli-sdl2-rs

Simple game of life with Cli and SDL2 rendering.
Based on example from https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2/blob/master/examples/game-of-life.rs.
Made for fun just to learn some Rust and SDL2.

# Run
Cli (keys: "ctrl+c" -> exit)
```
cargo run
```

SDL2 (keys: "esc" -> quit game, "space" -> start/pause game, "mouse-left-button" -> cell alive/dead)
```
cargo run sdl2
```
